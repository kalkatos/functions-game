# Functions Game Backend

Backend for a turn-based game running on a serverless architecture. The game implemented is rock-paper-scissors for the Azure Functions platform, but the code is modular enough to change the game and the service provider more easily.

The front-end is implemented in a rock-paper-scissors game for Unity [here](https://github.com/kalkatos/rpsls) using the following parts: [C-sharp base scripts](https://github.com/kalkatos/csharpgame), with [Unity specific utility scripts](https://github.com/kalkatos/unitygame), an implementation of [Scriptable Objects Architecture](https://github.com/kalkatos/scriptable) to emit UI Signals, and a modular [network](https://github.com/kalkatos/network) framework.

For a thorough explanation of how this works encompasing all modules, please refer to my website [here](https://kalkatos.com/serverlessgame/).
