# Functions Game Backend

Backend for a turn-based game running on a serverless architecture. The game implemented is rock-paper-scissors for the Azure Functions platform, but the code is modular enough to change the game and the service provider more easily.

For a thorough explanation of how this works encompasing all modules, please refer to my website [here](https://kalkatos.com/serverlessgame/).
